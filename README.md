# PTPlayer
A player library for [Polytone files](spec.md) (.POL), with the ability to also load legacy MONOTONE (.MON) files. It is a supersession of [MTPlayer](https://github.com/prochazkaml/MTPlayer), used primarily in the [Polytone](https://github.com/prochazkaml/Polytone) tracker. However, it can also be used as a standalone player program (supplied in this repo, uses PortAudio for audio output) or it can even be incorporated into your own productions, should you choose.

[Here is a primitive web-based player built using this library.](https://ptplayer.prochazkaml.eu/)

## What is MONOTONE?
MONOTONE (created by Trixter / Hornet) is a tracker (song editor), similar to programs like [OpenMPT](https://openmpt.org/).
However, unlike OpenMPT, which is sample/FM-based, MONOTONE is aimed for much simpler audio devices,
it only supports one kind of instrument (a square wave) at a constant volume.
Its music file format (.MON files) is usually only a couple of kB in size.

My first attempt at .MON playback was [MTPlayer](https://github.com/prochazkaml/MTPlayer), which was mostly just a translation of the original MONOTONE tracker source code from Pascal to C.
PTPlayer is just an expansion of that library, with support for the new Polytone files.

## What is Polytone?
Polytone is my own modern implementation of MONOTONE. Please visit its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/prochazkaml/Polytone) for more info.

## Why was the new file format needed?
The main reason I reworked MTPlayer into PTPlayer and created a new file format is because of the limited 6-bit effect values of the old .MON format. That means that the largest value an effect can have is 63, or 7/7 with arpeggio/vibrato. You couldn't even make more advanced chords with it. But I understand why that decision by the MONOTONE devs was made â€“ each data point (note+effect+value) neatly took up exactly 2 bytes. So order to have full 8-bit effect values (up to 255, or 15/15 with arpeggio/vibrato) without the file size bloating up, rudimentary pattern packing was implemented. It's by no means perfect, but it gets the job done, and often results in even _lower_ file sizes than .MON files themselves!

TL;DR: You can now have up to 15 semitone chords, which is over an octave! Seriously, try the 0CC effect on a note. It's awesome.
